## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

As an avid camper/hiker I love to visit the U.S. National Parks, and for one of my first projects utilizing API's I wanted to combine this passion into a simple project. I was able to fetch data from the NPS API and display the current locations of where to find stamps for your National Park Passport.

## Optimizations

Currently, the API only works by searching the parks through their abbreviated code name. I would like to eventually add the functionality so that the user may type in the actual name of the park since these codes aren't common knowledge. 

## Lessons Learned:

I learned a method of updating the DOM by using fragments. Initially my code would keep adding more locations to the list instead of replacing the current data, but with the use of fragments I was able to update these elements every time a new search was input.

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
